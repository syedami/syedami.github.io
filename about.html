                    The Boston University on-campus housing website currently lacks crucial 
                    information for newcomers to BU and Boston. It should provide more detailed 
                    descriptions, photos, and local area guides to help students make informed 
                    housing decisions and ease their transition.</p>

                <p>We aim to introduce a roommate matchmaking feature, allowing users to create profiles,
                    answer a series of questions, and receive personalized recommendations for potential roommates.
                    This system would function similarly to popular dating apps like Tinder but with the added layer 
                    of BU authentication to ensure that users are indeed BU students. This feature will help students 
                    find compatible roommates for their BU experience.</p>
